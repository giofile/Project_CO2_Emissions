By examining the growth trajectories of energy sources such as wind, solar, and bioenergy, we aim to understand the dynamic expansion of renewables in the global energy landscape. This visualization offers insights into how different renewable technologies have scaled over time, helping identify which technologies have made the most significant contributions to the overall increase in global installed capacity.*"
