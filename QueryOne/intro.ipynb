        "This analysis explores the primary factors that contribute to high CO2 emissions per capita in various countries. By examining key indicators such as economic activity, energy consumption, and industrial output, we aim to identify the most significant predictor of a countryâ€™s large CO2 output per capita. The findings provide valuable insights into the global patterns of carbon emissions and can guide strategies for reducing CO2 emissions at a national level."
